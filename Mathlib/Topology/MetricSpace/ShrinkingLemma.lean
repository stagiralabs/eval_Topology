# Shrinking lemma in a proper metric space

In this file we prove a few versions of the shrinking lemma for coverings by balls in a proper
(pseudo) metric space.

/-- **Shrinking lemma** for coverings by open balls in a proper metric space. A point-finite open
cover of a closed subset of a proper metric space by open balls can be shrunk to a new cover by
open balls so that each of the new balls has strictly smaller radius than the old one. This version
assumes that `fun x ↦ ball (c i) (r i)` is a locally finite covering and provides a covering
indexed by the same type. -/

/-- Let `R : α → ℝ` be a (possibly discontinuous) function on a proper metric space.
Let `s` be a closed set in `α` such that `R` is positive on `s`. Then there exists a collection of
pairs of balls `Metric.ball (c i) (r i)`, `Metric.ball (c i) (r' i)` such that

* all centers belong to `s`;
* for all `i` we have `0 < r i < r' i < R (c i)`;
* the family of balls `Metric.ball (c i) (r' i)` is locally finite;
* the balls `Metric.ball (c i) (r i)` cover `s`.

This is a simple corollary of `refinement_of_locallyCompact_sigmaCompact_of_nhds_basis_set`
and `exists_subset_iUnion_ball_radius_pos_lt`. -/
