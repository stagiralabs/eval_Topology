# Algebraic facts about the topology of uniform convergence

This file contains algebraic compatibility results about the uniform structure of uniform
convergence / `𝔖`-convergence. They will mostly be useful for defining strong topologies on the
space of continuous linear maps between two topological vector spaces.

## Main statements

* `UniformOnFun.continuousSMul_induced_of_image_bounded` : let `E` be a TVS, `𝔖 : Set (Set α)` and
  `H` a submodule of `α →ᵤ[𝔖] E`. If the image of any `S ∈ 𝔖` by any `u ∈ H` is bounded (in the
  sense of `Bornology.IsVonNBounded`), then `H`, equipped with the topology induced from
  `α →ᵤ[𝔖] E`, is a TVS.

## Implementation notes

Like in `Mathlib.Topology.UniformSpace.UniformConvergenceTopology`, we use the type aliases
`UniformFun` (denoted `α →ᵤ β`) and `UniformOnFun` (denoted `α →ᵤ[𝔖] β`) for functions from `α`
to `β` endowed with the structures of uniform convergence and `𝔖`-convergence.

/-- Let `E` be a topological vector space over a normed field `𝕜`, let `α` be any type.
Let `H` be a submodule of `α →ᵤ E` such that the range of each `f ∈ H` is von Neumann bounded.
Then `H` is a topological vector space over `𝕜`,
i.e., the pointwise scalar multiplication is continuous in both variables.

For convenience we require that `H` is a vector space over `𝕜`
with a topology induced by `UniformFun.ofFun ∘ φ`, where `φ : H →ₗ[𝕜] (α → E)`. -/

/-- Let `E` be a TVS, `𝔖 : Set (Set α)` and `H` a submodule of `α →ᵤ[𝔖] E`. If the image of any
`S ∈ 𝔖` by any `u ∈ H` is bounded (in the sense of `Bornology.IsVonNBounded`), then `H`,
equipped with the topology of `𝔖`-convergence, is a TVS.

For convenience, we don't literally ask for `H : Submodule (α →ᵤ[𝔖] E)`. Instead, we prove the
result for any vector space `H` equipped with a linear inducing to `α →ᵤ[𝔖] E`, which is often
easier to use. We also state the `Submodule` version as
`UniformOnFun.continuousSMul_submodule_of_image_bounded`. -/

If you have a hard time using this lemma, try the one above instead. -/
