# The vector bundle of continuous (semi)linear maps

We define the (topological) vector bundle of continuous (semi)linear maps between two vector bundles
over the same base.

Given bundles `E₁ E₂ : B → Type*`, normed spaces `F₁` and `F₂`, and a ring-homomorphism `σ` between
their respective scalar fields, we define `Bundle.ContinuousLinearMap σ F₁ E₁ F₂ E₂ x` to be a
type synonym for `fun x ↦ E₁ x →SL[σ] E₂ x`. If the `E₁` and `E₂` are vector bundles with model
fibers `F₁` and `F₂`, then this will be a vector bundle with fiber `F₁ →SL[σ] F₂`.

The topology on the total space is constructed from the trivializations for `E₁` and `E₂` and the
norm-topology on the model fiber `F₁ →SL[𝕜] F₂` using the `VectorPrebundle` construction.  This is
a bit awkward because it introduces a dependence on the normed space structure of the model fibers,
rather than just their topological vector space structure; it is not clear whether this is
necessary.

Similar constructions should be possible (but are yet to be formalized) for tensor products of
topological vector bundles, exterior algebras, and so on, where again the topology can be defined
using a norm on the fiber model if this helps.

## Main Definitions

* `Bundle.ContinuousLinearMap.vectorBundle`: continuous semilinear maps between
  vector bundles form a vector bundle.
