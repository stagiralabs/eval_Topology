# Constructions relating polynomial functions and continuous functions.

## Main definitions

* `Polynomial.toContinuousMapOn p X`: for `X : Set R`, interprets a polynomial `p`
  as a bundled continuous function in `C(X, R)`.
* `Polynomial.toContinuousMapOnAlgHom`: the same, as an `R`-algebra homomorphism.
* `polynomialFunctions (X : Set R) : Subalgebra R C(X, R)`: polynomial functions as a subalgebra.
* `polynomialFunctions_separatesPoints (X : Set R) : (polynomialFunctions X).SeparatesPoints`:
  the polynomial functions separate points.
